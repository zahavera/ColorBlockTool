Gihub repository url is https://github.com/zahavera/ColorBlockTool

Hey can you see and understand the features of this code?

it is a tool that is ran on my github repositories page.

there is also a way for me to host it locally so we dont have to push it to the repository to test every time.

but i want it to look good on mobile so we will have to push it to test it on mobile eventually.
